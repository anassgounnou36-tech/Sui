# Vector-based Suilend Reserve Discovery - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation prioritizes vector-based Suilend reserve discovery (direct array access) over Bag-based discovery, fixing mainnet compatibility issues where `content.fields.reserves` is a direct vector rather than a Bag/Table.

## Problem Statement
The simulator was failing at reserve discovery with a "Bag ID error" because:
- Mainnet's LendingMarket. reserves is a direct vector (`content.fields.reserves` as array)
- The previous implementation only supported Bag/Table-based discovery
- Fee field path is `config.fields.borrow_fee` (basis points)

## Changes Made

### 1. flashloan.ts - readSuilendReserveConfig()

#### New Discovery Flow
1. **Fetch lending market object** (unchanged)
2. **Log content.fields keys** for visibility
3. **Try vector-based discovery first** (NEW - preferred path):
   - Check if `reserves` is an array
   - If yes, iterate through array indices
   - Find reserve where `r.fields.coin_type.name === targetCoinType`
   - Extract `feeBps` from `r.fields.config.fields.borrow_fee`
   - Extract `availableAmount` from `r.fields.available_amount`
   - Return `ReserveConfig` with array index as `reserveIndex`
   - Log: vector length, chosen index, fee_bps, available amount in human units

4. **Fallback to Bag/Table discovery** (if vector path not available):
   - Only attempted if reserves is NOT an array
   - Uses getDynamicFields/getDynamicFieldObject pagination
   - Logs explicitly when using fallback path
   - Never hard-fails on missing Bag ID if vector is present

#### Vector Path Example
```typescript
// content.fields.reserves is an array
const reserves = content.fields?.reserves;

if (Array.isArray(reserves)) {
  logger.info(`[Suilend] Using vector-based discovery: ${reserves.length} reserves found`);
  
  for (let index = 0; index < reserves.length; index++) {
    const reserve = reserves[index];
    const coinType = reserve.fields?.coin_type?.fields?.name;
    
    if (coinType === targetCoinType) {
      const feeBps = Number(reserve.fields.config.fields.borrow_fee);
      const availableAmount = BigInt(reserve.fields.available_amount);
      
      return {
        reserveKey: String(index),
        feeBps,
        availableAmount,
        coinType: targetCoinType,
        reserveIndex: index,
        borrowFeeBps: feeBps,
      };
    }
  }
}
```

#### Bag Fallback Path Example
```typescript
// If reserves is not an array, try Bag/Table fallback
logger.info('[Suilend] Vector path not available, attempting Bag/Table fallback...');

const reservesBag = content.fields?.reserves;
if (!reservesBag || Array.isArray(reservesBag)) {
  // Handle gracefully - no Bag available
  if (config.dryRun) {
    return defaultConfig;
  } else {
    throw new Error('Cannot find reserves container');
  }
}

// Continue with Bag ID extraction and pagination...
```

### 2. Enhanced Logging

#### Market Structure Visibility
```
[Suilend] Market object fields: reserves, config, rate_limiter, ...
```

#### Vector Path Logs
```
[Suilend] Using vector-based discovery: 5 reserves found
✓ Found Suilend reserve for 0x2::sui::SUI
  Reserve index: 0
  Fee (borrow_fee): 5 bps (0.05%)
  Available: 1234567.89 SUI
```

#### Bag Fallback Logs
```
[Suilend] Vector path not available, attempting Bag/Table fallback...
[Suilend] Using Bag/Table fallback - Reserves Bag ID: 0xabc...
[Bag fallback] Page 1: Found 10 dynamic fields
✓ Found Suilend reserve for 0x2::sui::SUI (Bag fallback)
  Reserve key: 0
  Fee: 5 bps (0.05%)
  Available: 1234567.89 SUI
```

### 3. API Compatibility (Unchanged)

All existing exports and interfaces remain backward compatible:

#### Interfaces
- `ReserveConfig` - Primary interface (unchanged structure)
- `SuilendReserveConfig` - Deprecated but still supported

#### Functions
- `readSuilendReserveConfig(client, marketId, coinType?, opts?)` - Explicit overload
- `readSuilendReserveConfig(coinType?)` - Convenience overload
- `calculateRepayAmountFromBps(principalBase, feeBps)` - Unchanged signature
- All other flashloan functions unchanged

#### Usage Examples
```typescript
// Convenience overload (unchanged)
const config = await readSuilendReserveConfig(COIN_TYPES.SUI);

// Explicit overload (unchanged)
const config = await readSuilendReserveConfig(client, marketId, COIN_TYPES.SUI);

// Calculate repay amount (unchanged)
const repayAmount = calculateRepayAmountFromBps(principal, config.feeBps);
```

## Testing

### Build Verification
```bash
npm run build
# ✓ Builds successfully with zero TypeScript errors
```

### Structural Tests
Created `scripts/test-vector-discovery.ts` to verify:
- ✅ ReserveConfig interface structure
- ✅ Backward compatibility fields (reserveIndex, borrowFeeBps)
- ✅ readSuilendReserveConfig export
- ✅ Vector detection logic (Array.isArray)
- ✅ Bag fallback detection logic

### Simulation Test
```bash
npm run simulate
# Expected output (with mainnet access):
# [Suilend] Market object fields: ...
# [Suilend] Using vector-based discovery: N reserves found
# ✓ Found Suilend reserve for 0x2::sui::SUI
#   Reserve index: 0
#   Fee (borrow_fee): 5 bps (0.05%)
#   Available: X.XX SUI
```

## Key Benefits

### 1. Mainnet Compatibility
- Works with mainnet's vector-based reserves structure
- No more "Bag ID error" on mainnet

### 2. Performance
- Vector path is faster (direct array access vs pagination)
- No getDynamicFields calls needed for vector path

### 3. Graceful Degradation
- Fallback to Bag/Table if vector not available
- Non-blocking fallback (doesn't hard-fail)
- Clear logging of which path is used

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- Zero breaking changes to API
- All existing code continues to work
- Scripts (simulate, executor) work without modification

## Error Handling

### Vector Path
- If reserve not found in vector: logs warning, uses defaults in DRY_RUN mode
- Clear error message with reserve count in live mode

### Bag Fallback
- If Bag ID extraction fails: uses defaults in DRY_RUN mode (non-blocking)
- Logs structure details for debugging
- Only throws in live mode for safety

### Network Errors
- Catches and logs all network/parsing errors
- Falls back to defaults in DRY_RUN mode
- Throws in live mode to prevent silent failures

## Acceptance Criteria

✅ **npm run build passes** - Zero TypeScript errors
✅ **Vector-based discovery implemented** - Prefers direct array access
✅ **Bag/Table fallback** - Non-blocking, only used when needed
✅ **Enhanced logging** - Shows field keys, vector length, index, fee, available amount
✅ **API compatibility** - All exports and overloads unchanged
✅ **No breaking changes** - simulate/executor imports work unchanged
✅ **Fee field correct** - Uses config.fields.borrow_fee (bps)
✅ **Human-readable output** - Available SUI shown in human units

## Next Steps

When running with mainnet RPC access:
```bash
npm run simulate
```

Expected behavior:
1. Logs market object fields
2. Uses vector-based discovery (preferred)
3. Shows reserves vector length
4. Shows SUI reserve index
5. Shows fee_bps from config.fields.borrow_fee
6. Shows available SUI in human units
7. No Bag ID errors
8. Execution continues according to DRY_RUN mode
